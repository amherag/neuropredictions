 
What's new in AGENT0 ?

4/29/91  o  Wrote LISP PARSER to parse the new Lisp syntax for AGENT0
             programs.  See the file joetriv.lisp for an example
	 o  Wrote a BNF for the new syntax, in file bnf.txt
         o  Implemented parser for initial beliefs
         o  New command: 'new' prints this message
         o  Pressing RETURN while in run mode no longer breaks
         o  New command: 'go <agent>' makes that agent the current
             agent (old method of typing agent name alone still works)
         o  Fixed problem with Allegro Lisp needing initial RETURN
         o  Changed the name to AGENT0 release 1.0

COMING SOON:
         o  Multiple windows--one for each agent, with buttons
         o  Agents can spawn new agents
         o  Privacy of function names so different agents can have
             different private actions with the same name
         o  Support for negated message conditions and mental conditions
         o  Actually use the timegrain when running agents
         o  Better error catching of mistyped commands
         o  Better time in initial beliefs, better than raw integers
